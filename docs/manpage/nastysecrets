.SH NAME
NastySecrets \- A security/privacy tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
nastysecrets [arguments] [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
NastySecrets is a security/privacy tool with which you can encrypt/decrypt files in a directory recursively. Users can choose to rename files to "temp" for added privacy.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments

-e      Perform encryption

-d      Perform decryption

-p      Folder to encrypt/decrypt its files recursively

-v      Print the current version

Options

-n      Rename files to 'temp' for added privacy
        Default: false
        This option will rename the files after encryption. A counter is
        used to rename files uniquely. Example: "temp1", "temp2", "temp3"
        and so on. This how the tool can identify the correct file to
        rename back while decrypting.

-t      How many files to encrpyt/decrypt simultaneously
        Default: 8
        It is generally recommended to keep this number low. 1-25 threads
        should be enough. Anything higher will actually slow the process down
        and in extreme cases it can cause the os to kill the process leading    
        to incomplete encryption/decryption process and/or data loss.

-o      Path to write the config file to
        Default: ./nasty
        This config file is a JSON file containing everything that is needed for
        future decryption. It contains the base64 representation of the key and
        in case the files were renamed, the renamed name of the file and the
        encrypted original file name so that it is possible to rename the files 
        back when decrypting.

-c      Config file's path for decryption or re-using an old key
        (Mandatory for decryption)
        In case the user wants to re-use an old key
        (a key from a previous encryption by NastySecrets) this can be 
        provided while using the "-e" flag. This file will be overwritten once 
        the encryption is completed with the new data.

.SH Examples
Simple encryption:

    nastysecrets -e -p /folder/to/encrypt

Encrypt 16 files simultaneously:

    nastysecrets -e -p /folder/to/encrypt -t 16

Also rename files to temp:

    nastysecrets -e -p /folder/to/encrypt -n

Save config file to ./config:

    nastysecrets -e -p /folder/to/encrypt -o ./config

Use the key from the config file:

    nastysecrets -e -p /folder/to/encrypt -c ./config               

Simple decryption:

    nastysecrets -d -p /folder/to/decrypt -c ./config

Decrypt 10 files simultaneously:

    nastysecrets -d -p /folder/to/decrypt -c ./config -t 10
